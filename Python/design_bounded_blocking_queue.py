"""
Implement a thread safe bounded blocking queue that has the following methods:
  - Constructor intializes the queue with a maximum capacity
  - Enqueue() adds and element to the front of the queue. If the queue is full, the calling thread is blocked until the queue is no longer full
  - Dequeue() returns the element at the rear of the queue and removes it. If the queue is empty, the calling thread is blocked until the queue is no longer empty
  - Size() returns the number of elements currently in the queue
